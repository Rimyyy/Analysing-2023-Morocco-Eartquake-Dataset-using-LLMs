The dataset was collected using API.The project involves using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models—BERT, RoBERTa, and T5—to analyze text data effectively. Each model serves a unique purpose: BERT and RoBERTa perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) to identify entities like names, locations, and organizations, while T5 handles text generation tasks, such as summarization or rephrasing. The project follows a structured pipeline, from data preprocessing and tokenization to classification, aggregation, and visualization of results. By leveraging these powerful models together, the project provides a comprehensive approach to text analysis, entity extraction, categorization, and text transformation.
